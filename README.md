• Data Table: Display a table that shows data retrieved from provided json.

• Filters: Implement filters for the data table. Users should be able to filter the data based on country and region, and the results should display name and email.

• Search Bar: User should be able to search for name and email.

• Pagination: The table should support pagination to display a limited number of rows per page. Users should be able to navigate between pages.

• Add Data Form: Create a form that allows users to add new data to the table in real-time. The form should include fields relevant to the data.

• Real-time Update: When a user adds new data using the form, the table should update in real-time without requiring a page refresh.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
